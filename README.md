Built using create-react-app. The project was built using Bootstrap, Sass, React. The project uses Webpack for dev and build tools.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

This will pull down all the projects dependencies

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.


### The build system can be extended to include things such as deployments to staging and production.
I'll typically use a service like aerobatic.io or github to deploy my static websites right from command line.
